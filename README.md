# MUPWIT - MUsic Player WIth Things

> [!WARNING]
> **WIP**! It is still kinda raw and missing some useful features, but hey, it
> is already capable of managing playback and queue, so check it out!!

A small and simple [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org) client written in C99 and
[RAYLIB](https://www.raylib.com).

It is not a serious MPD client with fancy features, it was made just for fun
and learning purposes.
